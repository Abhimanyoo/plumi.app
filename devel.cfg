# Plumi development buildout
# ==========================
#
# Use this for development instances:
#  
#  - nginx and varnish are not built
#
#  - there is no load balancing 
#
#  - additional development tools such as plone.reload, Products.PdbDebugMode,
#    Products.PrintingMailHost, Products.DocFinderTab and mr.developer are
#    installed. Look for these on http://pypi.python.org/pypi for more
#    details.
